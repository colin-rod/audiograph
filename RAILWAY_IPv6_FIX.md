# üîß Quick Fix: Railway IPv6 Connection Error

## The Problem

You're seeing:
```
Error: connect ENETUNREACH 2a05:d018:...
```

**Root Cause**: Railway is trying to connect via IPv6, which doesn't work in their network.

## The Solution (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Get Supabase Pooler URL

1. Go to: https://app.supabase.com/project/btgvrkfujiqwqbshcity/settings/database
2. Find "**Connection string**" section
3. Click the "**Connection pooling**" tab
4. Select "**Transaction**" mode
5. Click "**Copy**" - the URL should look like:
   ```
   postgresql://postgres.btgvrkfujiqwqbshcity:[password]@aws-0-[region].pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres
   ```

### Step 2: Update Railway Environment Variable

1. Go to Railway ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí Worker Service
2. Click "**Variables**" tab
3. Find `DATABASE_URL` (or add it if missing)
4. **Replace** with the pooler URL from Step 1
5. Click "**Deploy**"

## Key Differences

| Type | Port | Hostname | Works in Railway? |
|------|------|----------|-------------------|
| **Direct** | 5432 | `db.xxx.supabase.co` | ‚ùå No (IPv6 issues) |
| **Pooler** | 6543 | `aws-0-region.pooler.supabase.com` | ‚úÖ Yes (IPv4 only) |

## Verify It Works

After redeploying, check Railway logs. You should see:

```
‚úÖ [Queue] Connection string found, attempting to connect...
‚úÖ [Queue] Detected Supabase connection, adding connection parameters...
‚úÖ [Queue] Initializing pg-boss...
‚úÖ [Queue] Starting pg-boss...
‚úÖ [Queue] pg-boss started successfully
‚úÖ [Worker] Upload processor worker started successfully
```

## Still Having Issues?

1. Double-check the password in the connection string
2. Ensure `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is also set in Railway
3. Verify you selected "Transaction" mode (not "Session")
4. Check that the pooler URL uses port `6543` not `5432`

## Why This Happens

- Supabase's direct connection (`db.xxx.supabase.co`) resolves to both IPv4 and IPv6
- Railway's Node.js tries IPv6 first
- Railway's network doesn't support IPv6 for outbound connections
- The pooler (`pooler.supabase.com`) is IPv4-only, so it always works

## Do I Need to Change Local Development?

**No!** Your local `.env.local` can keep using the direct connection (port 5432).

Only Railway needs the pooler URL.
