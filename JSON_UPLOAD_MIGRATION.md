# ‚úÖ Migration Complete: ZIP ‚Üí JSON Upload

## What Changed

We've completely replaced ZIP file uploads with direct JSON file uploads. This eliminates all the complexity and issues we were experiencing.

### Before (ZIP Upload)
```
User uploads ZIP ‚Üí Extract files ‚Üí Validate ‚Üí Queue jobs ‚Üí Process
```
**Problems**:
- SSL certificate issues
- IPv6 connection problems
- Complex extraction logic
- Hidden file validation
- Compression overhead
- Mobile compatibility issues

### After (JSON Upload)
```
User selects JSON files ‚Üí Validate ‚Üí Queue jobs ‚Üí Process
```
**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ No more SSL/certificate issues
- ‚úÖ No more ZIP extraction complexity
- ‚úÖ Better user experience (see files before upload)
- ‚úÖ Faster processing (no extraction step)
- ‚úÖ Better error messages (per-file validation)
- ‚úÖ Mobile friendly
- ‚úÖ Simpler codebase

## New User Flow

### 1. Download from Spotify
User downloads their Spotify Extended Streaming History (comes as a ZIP)

### 2. Extract Files
User extracts the ZIP themselves (using their OS)

### 3. Select Files
User selects the JSON files they want to upload:
- Can select one or multiple files at once
- Drag and drop supported
- Files are validated before upload
- Invalid files are shown with reasons

### 4. Upload
- All selected files uploaded together
- Progress tracking per file
- Clear error messages if any file fails

## Supported File Formats

The following Spotify JSON file patterns are supported:

```
‚úÖ Streaming_History_Audio_*.json  (Extended Streaming History)
‚úÖ StreamingHistory*.json           (Old format)
‚úÖ endsong*.json                    (Old format)
```

Files that don't match these patterns will be rejected with a clear error message.

## File Validation

Each file is validated for:
- ‚úÖ Must be a `.json` file
- ‚úÖ Must match Spotify file name patterns
- ‚úÖ Must be ‚â§ 10MB (configurable)
- ‚úÖ Must not be empty
- ‚úÖ Must be valid JSON

Users see validation results immediately:
- ‚úÖ **Green** = Ready to upload
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Amber** = Invalid file (with reason)

## API Endpoint

**New**: `POST /api/uploads/json`

**Accepts**:
- Single or multiple JSON files via `FormData`
- Content-Type: `multipart/form-data`
- Field name: `files` (array)

**Returns**:
```json
{
  "uploadJobId": "abc-123",
  "totalFiles": 3,
  "skippedFiles": 0,
  "message": "Successfully queued 3 files for processing"
}
```

**Error Response**:
```json
{
  "error": "No valid Spotify JSON files found",
  "details": [
    "file1.json: Not a recognized Spotify file format",
    "file2.txt: Not a JSON file"
  ]
}
```

## Files Removed

The following files have been removed:
- ‚ùå `src/app/api/uploads/zip/route.ts`
- ‚ùå `src/lib/upload/zip-extractor.ts`
- ‚ùå `src/lib/upload/zip-extractor.test.ts`
- ‚ùå `src/app/upload/page_old.tsx` (backup)

The `jszip` package is still in `package.json` but is no longer used.

## Files Added

- ‚úÖ `src/app/api/uploads/json/route.ts` - New JSON upload endpoint
- ‚úÖ `src/app/upload/page.tsx` - Completely rewritten UI

## UI Changes

### New Features
1. **Multi-file selection** - Select multiple files at once
2. **File list preview** - See all selected files before upload
3. **Per-file validation** - Each file validated individually
4. **Remove files** - Remove individual files from selection
5. **Better feedback** - Clear error messages per file
6. **Progress tracking** - See processing progress

### Visual Improvements
- File icons for JSON files
- Color-coded validation (green/amber)
- Clear error messages
- Drag and drop UI
- Responsive design

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Single JSON file upload
- [ ] Multiple JSON files upload (5+ files)
- [ ] Mix of valid and invalid files
- [ ] Drag and drop files
- [ ] Remove files before upload
- [ ] Large file validation (>10MB)
- [ ] Invalid JSON validation
- [ ] Wrong file extension validation
- [ ] Wrong file name pattern validation
- [ ] Progress tracking
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] Success redirect to dashboard

## Deployment

### Vercel
1. Push changes to main branch
2. Vercel will auto-deploy
3. No environment variable changes needed

### Railway (Worker)
1. Worker code unchanged
2. No redeploy needed
3. Will process jobs same as before

## User Instructions

Update your landing page / documentation:

### Old Instructions
```
1. Download your Spotify Extended Streaming History
2. Upload the ZIP file to Audiograph
3. Wait for processing
```

### New Instructions
```
1. Download your Spotify Extended Streaming History
2. Extract the ZIP file
3. Select the Streaming_History_Audio_*.json files
4. Upload to Audiograph
5. Wait for processing
```

## Advantages Summary

| Feature | ZIP Upload | JSON Upload |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Complexity | High | Low |
| SSL Issues | Yes | No |
| User Visibility | Hidden | Transparent |
| Error Messages | Generic | Specific |
| Mobile Support | Poor | Good |
| Speed | Slower | Faster |
| File Preview | No | Yes |
| Validation | Post-upload | Pre-upload |
| Progress | Opaque | Clear |

## Migration Notes

- ‚úÖ No database changes needed
- ‚úÖ Worker code unchanged
- ‚úÖ Queue system unchanged
- ‚úÖ All existing uploads still work
- ‚úÖ No breaking changes to API
- ‚úÖ Backward compatible (no old data affected)

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Deploy to production
2. ‚úÖ Test with real Spotify data
3. ‚úÖ Monitor error rates
4. üìù Update user documentation
5. üìù Update landing page copy
6. üîÑ Consider removing `jszip` from package.json in future cleanup

## Rollback Plan

If needed, the old ZIP upload code is available in:
- `src/app/upload/page_old.tsx` (backup)

To rollback:
1. Restore old upload page
2. Restore ZIP API endpoint
3. Restore zip-extractor files
4. Reinstall jszip dependency

However, the JSON upload is much more reliable and simpler, so rollback should not be necessary.
